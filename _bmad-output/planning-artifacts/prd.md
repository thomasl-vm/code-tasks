# Product Requirements Document - code-tasks

**Author:** Thomas
**Date:** 2026-03-10

## Executive Summary

**code-tasks** is a high-velocity, PWA-first application designed for developers to capture technical ideas and tasks with the speed and security of a native app. By utilizing GitHub as a transparent, conflict-free backend via `captured-ideas-{username}.md` files, it eliminates the overhead of manual task synchronization and central database dependencies.

### What Makes This Special
- **Native-Like Performance:** Optimized for a < 5-second "pocket-to-captured" loop.
- **AI-Native Orchestration:** Automated "AI-Ready" headers transform static Markdown into living task lists for agents like Gemini and Claude Code.
- **"Overnight Offline" Reliability:** Strategic local persistence ensures data integrity regardless of connection quality, syncing seamlessly when connectivity returns.
- **Zero-Conflict Scaling:** The `{username}` suffix enables collaboration in shared repositories without merge conflict overhead.

## Success Criteria

### User Success
- **The 5-Second Sprint:** Completion of the "Cold Start to Captured" loop in < 5 seconds.
- **Sync Reliability:** 100% success rate for automatic background syncing of offline ideas upon reconnection.
- **AI Interoperability:** 0 manual edits required for AI agents to interpret and process the Markdown lists.

### Technical Success
- **Zero Conflict Rate:** 0% merge conflicts in shared repositories via the scoping strategy.
- **Load Performance:** Core capture UI interactive (TTI) in < 1.5s on 4G connections.
- **Data Integrity:** 0% reported data loss during offline-to-online transitions.

## Product Scope

### Phase 1: MVP (Zero-Friction PWA)
- **Identity:** GitHub OAuth with persistent local session management.
- **Routing:** Intelligent "Last Opened Repo" default with a high-fidelity selector.
- **Input:** "The Pulse" text area with "Important" priority pills and fluid animations.
- **Storage:** IndexedDB local persistence with automated synchronization logic.
- **Markdown:** Automated injection of AI-Ready headers and formatted task appends.

### Phase 2: Growth (Mobile Presence & Discovery)
- **Store Readiness:** Native iOS and Android wrappers via Capacitor/similar.
- **Search:** Global repository and account-wide task search functionality.
- **Notifications:** Push alerts for sync status and agent execution milestones.

### Phase 3: Expansion (Control Center)
- **Dashboard:** "Digital Silk" interface for advanced task organization.
- **Orchestration:** Integrated UI triggers to initiate agent execution.

## User Journeys

### 1. The High-Velocity Developer (Success Path)
- **Scene:** breakthrough in transit; needs to capture an idea immediately.
- **Action:** Opens app (< 1.5s), types into Pulse, toggles "Important," and swipes to capture.
- **Outcome:** Idea is on GitHub before they reach their destination; ready for morning execution.

### 2. The Overnight Hacker (Reliability Case)
- **Scene:** Late-night ideation with intermittent or no connectivity.
- **Action:** App indicates "Offline," but captures ideas securely to local IndexedDB.
- **Outcome:** System silently pushes all updates to GitHub upon reconnection at 8 AM.

### 3. The AI Agent Consumer (Integration Case)
- **Scene:** Agent parses the repository to begin the workday.
- **Action:** Agent reads the AI-Ready header and follows the priority instructions.
- **Outcome:** Agent executes tasks and updates Markdown status without manual human context.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Identity & Data Management
- **FR1:** Users can authenticate securely via GitHub OAuth.
- **FR2:** Users can select a target repository with a persistent "Last Used" default.
- **FR3:** System can securely persist access tokens locally for recurring sessions.

### 2. Capture & Interaction
- **FR4:** Users can enter task titles/descriptions via the "Pulse" interface.
- **FR5:** Users can toggle "Important" flags and trigger capture via a single gesture.
- **FR6:** System can provide immediate animation-based feedback upon local capture.

### 3. Synchronization & Formatting
- **FR7:** System can store ideas in IndexedDB to prevent data loss during offline sessions.
- **FR8:** System can automatically synchronize pending changes to GitHub upon reconnection.
- **FR9:** System can inject standardized AI-Ready headers and metadata into `captured-ideas-{username}.md`.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance & Quality
- **Latency:** TTI < 1.5s; UI animations maintained at a consistent 60 FPS.
- **Security:** Tokens and local data encrypted at rest; all API traffic over HTTPS.
- **Reliability:** 100% data retention for captured ideas; exponential backoff for failed syncs.

## Project Classification
- **Type:** Mobile App (PWA-First / Cross-Platform Ready)
- **Domain:** Developer Tools
- **Complexity:** Medium/High (Sync Engine, GitHub API, UX Fidelity)
- **Context:** Greenfield
